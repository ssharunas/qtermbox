Place for termbox library.
There should be:
  * termbox.h - header file for termbox
  * libtermbox.a - staticaly complied termbox library (used for tests, you may use your own compiled library in your projects).

libtermbox.a is not included by default, you should compile it yourself (https://github.com/nsf/termbox)
